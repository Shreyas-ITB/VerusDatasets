 So today I'll be showing you how to make a cross chain currency conversion on Ferris Desktop on the Ferris Testnet. This is a PMS function that's going to come to Mainnet soon and it allows you to send from one blockchain to a completely separate blockchain and optionally convert in the process at the moment the desktop application does the conversion on exactly but if you are using the command line and in the future when you use the desktop you'll be able to send to a different chain without converting. So all you need to do is get the address that you want to send to on the other chain. So Moon is a blockchain created by a community member within the Ferris community completely independently from anything that we've done. You just use public blockchains in the service and the command line to launch his own chain. I can run Moon independently of Ferris Testnet. I don't it doesn't depend on Ferris Testnet. I can integrate Moon into my applications without caring about how Ferris Test works. So if I want to convert from Ferris Test to Moon I can go convert currencies. It'll search for the currencies I can convert to from Ferris Test and then it detects that Moon is one of them. And if I click this it'll automatically detect that it's going off chain and it's using the bridge currency on Moon to do the conversion. So I enter the destination address that I want to send to. Let's say I want to convert 100 Ferris Test to Moon. It can convert screen and posts the transaction. I will wait for it here to show up for a second. And as soon as this switches to the sent status it has been sent to Moon and it will arrive at the address that I specified around 20 to 30 minutes for now. In a completely decentralized way there's no centralized services going through this all occurs on both blockchains using the bridge currency. So the moment that this switches to sent I will turn off the recording and resume it after the Moon arrives. So there it go. It's been sent. It says the timeline has been sent on and now 20 to 30 minutes for now I should see it arrive in my Moon wallet. Around 20 minutes or so. And as you can see my balance has arrived on Moon is now here's the transaction. I mean it's come across chain. This is the transaction ID. If you were to run a Moon note and you look up the transaction ID it's all valid. It's all there. It has nine confirmations. So if I wanted to I could go from Moon back to various tests. Again through bridge.moon. And if I wanted to explore different PMS currencies I could go add public blockchains and service PMS chain. And it will show me the PMS chains that have been created so far by other community members like you can add them. I can convert to them if they have bridge currencies available. And yeah all this happens in a decentralized way. There's no central thing facilitating it. It's not arrived by the miners of both Moon and various tests. And yeah that was a short demo on how to send across chain with public blockchains as a service.
