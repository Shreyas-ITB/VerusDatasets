Right, so yeah, I just I mean I wanted to say happy new year of course and so might as well Becored that and So I think the last Meeting that I got on we talked about someone had contributed a few different features to the wallet and so though so You know we always go through a lot of testing when we get Updates so Be integrated those updates and we tested a lot of things and we actually found that we needed to disable the Couple of the features we effectively got TLS Connections so private encrypted connections that are working and then the others we disabled and the developer who contributed them Hasn't had a chance to respond or look at them so we're you know We can go back and we can fix those when we have time and and get them back in But we did a bunch of testing on everything and and currently We got LAS out of that work As everyone knows you know I was working I was working to try and get the Defi in shape and ready for main net and then there were other things going on and we had login and progress which is Actually working to some degree, but I think Dood's on the call he's working on some of the server side of things so I don't know where that is but I think general login on the client is there in native So rather than just kind of pick off little features What's going on obviously we didn't do a release for the end of last year with the TLS and part of the reason is you know We took in these changes for the TLS encrypted wallet faster z sinking in these things and Then of course we went through all of our testing for even going out to the community testing and we ran into issues on those and so we Both things out and change things and and removed any of those things so we have the auto boot strap on deck We have TLS connections on deck we have the auto ZCash parameter download on deck and We have a number of Pardon a lot of hardening work and a lot of work actually to get Not just a D5 but meaningful D5 and even though I said that it wasn't going to It did start spending time on the Ethereum contracts and working to get those hardened and in shape and ready to go and we also For our development assuming that you know we will work on a pull request at some point but we might It's open source so we'll size when we When we got there but we did fork and And work on the Laquality web extension wallet And some of us I was involved in doing that and was able to get kind of a Most of the framework in place for plugging in Support for Varus Does like a Meta mask style Interaction with websites And the log in that we have a native we expect to be able to have there I've since I was working a little bit with Michael to junior over the Break and so he's going to be working on that he's got a number of other things going on But we're not I don't think we're that far from having support And it's a nice web extension that is really nice actually Quality supports Bitcoin, oligon, Near Arbitrum, Dreckly, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dash, It supports a number of different networks Solana And they do swaps As part of the web extension actually And they have a plugin model that We're pretty far along on supporting And it's open source and I've been using it the development version that we're working on for a while. It's nice And so we also I also took a little bit of time to Reduce some of our server side functionality so I'm not I'm going to get a little technical just really quickly so people will understand So the way that we Do our functionality for Various All of the functions of the core protocol First they're in the protocol Through the demon which is also what people think of as Clive wallet, Currently a full node And that includes basically all of the functionality exposed in the protocol And then for light mode we use Electrum servers and Updated Kind of scalability updated Modified version of light wallet D, Z, Uh, Dernolage transactions And you know the plan to Have ID support Was to extend which we already did in fact Light wallet D to support IDs And in looking at this Extension and the way that they're doing things and the way that other people Other projects Bitcoin Um, The commoto and others I've been doing some of the functionality it's kind of a mix of all these things And you know there's this server Bitcoin D, RPC Which people are using for the inside explorer And they're using for these different functions But in fact Bitcoin D, RPC, Was kind of for some of the modifications that everything made Was kind of like, and it's not like a big deal in the modification It was basically this interface to a node And it's wallet functions and other things And then there's another server on top of that bit core Um, Modo And that was kind of like a filter and a cache That allowed the Bitcoin D, RPC to be protected from Using the wallet functions and then exposed So it's really interesting that all of these different servers and pieces of software Even exist because They're all kind of trying to do similar things And a lot of them are really kind of doing the same thing And so a lecture has this terrible interface that doesn't map To the way that anyone does Smart transactions at all It only maps to a very specific Bitcoin way of looking at things that Limits itself to all just the specific Existing Bitcoin Functions But what it did was I extended First the Bitcoin D, RPC to include all of the various APIs that do not Effect wallet or depend on a wallet or control a node And those are the things that are really exposed Through Electramax or through Lightwallet D Or through all these other random server Tachments on top of it Um, Now we just have the ability to access APIs Through the demon with this intermediate server Doesn't acquire or give access Any wallet functions The can include ID look up To conclude all these different things And then we have a version that can include And we did, you know, I did kind of a comprehensive It supports all APIs That do not Equire the wallet or control the wallet Or control the node And so that means that with that In front of a node You know, we can do something much better than Electram Or lightwallet D or any of these And then when we cover that With this caching And it evolved kind of caching If you had we could probably get rid Of any dependency on Electram We could simplify our stack And it would effectively be, you know, the various Um, what might be like the web 3 API And at first we can expose this for applications And, you know, there's absolutely no reason at all That this API I couldn't turn into something that would be That could have in fewer business models behind it That kind of thing Of course, if we or anyone ever does something like that It would be nice to Make it payable with crypto because all of our decentralized bridges are too So Um That's been work going on And where are we? So Did get a lot of hardening work I would say all of the necessary hardening work Although it needs to get some Some work still on it There are a couple of reasons Into the contracts Into the Ethereum contracts Um, we did get A lot of progress On the forked web extension And I'm hoping that we're going to have one to use Community to use with, you know, various And it And the not too distant future Um, hopefully in weeks Uh And right now I've got the Ability to So as people have probably noticed If you've been using Tessnet, you know, going Between chains You can send easily between chains And you can now import an export Ideas between chains But you can't really Import an export currency Affinitions Between chains Which, you know, so when you make a bridge To a new chain Only the currencies that were defined And that bridge Can go back and forth And uh, and there isn't really a way to make multiple bridges So you can't really Extend the number of currencies And so I'm Not in that Um I'm working on Getting all of that hardened And it isn't just defy on one chain Because we're going to have the ETH bridge Which I think Either the ETH bridge or we need We've already, we've talked about Uh like a stable coin Mapped bridge Um as well So we can do both stable coins And we can do Mapped bridge Centralized party that could expose various currencies For example, through their centralized bridge That's also But you know When we get defy And when we get Um, the AMMs to main net Which is now what I've been 100% Well, I shouldn't say 100% Because I've been working on all of the different things that I said Um, but when we get that to main net Uh, we really should have a bridge to something That isn't just the value Being created on the various network We really Think it's important for us to have that So, um Because what that enables is Whether or not You can be excited About all that various has in it Um You can just use it because it's better The money of whatever kind you want And That's really just kind of impossible To That's when when I believe Um, the real usage comes Is when it's just Vailable for use with value You don't have to argue about What the currency is that's more important Or better you don't have to It's just it works and it works better For a lot of things that people Obviously do And want to do And I think the key to that is to make sure That value And whatever form As currencies And go in and out Of the various ecosystem And so that's You know that's been my focus Um, getting these different things done It's a combination of Making sure that we have defy Making sure that we have A bridge Whether that like before Defy is released to main net Bridge Bridge could be The bridge to Ethereum which it is much closer It's closer than it was It still needs work And I'm talking right now To a Solidarity developer if people know Really good solidity developers It's kind of kind of hard to find Solidarity developers who are also People who understand how You know Crosschain proofs can work And this kind of thing Um, so Definitely we're looking You know, a little bit of a verified space But if you know Some hard course, validity developers Um, and then my way Otherwise, you know, we're going to Going to get that Working And done And to shape that it can be Utited and recognized as being You know, rock solid But That's going to take whatever time it takes Meanwhile, I'm focused right now On getting the Uh, the Defy and Uh Crosschain technology that will be Required any of these Um, to be hardened Enough Be released on main net as soon as possible And then, you know, I know Um, Michael to junior Is right now I'm focused on the extension You know, I don't know Uh, number of people Just just to let you know And I don't want to say who And some people actually Both in development And um, in other Support functions You know, through this Recent kind of month, month and a Period. Got COVID And we're slowed down Um, some Or then others Um, you know, Still a bit slowed down So Um, there was a little bit of an impact there too Uh, And then aside from that You know, we're working on Uh, we've got this release So upcoming release Will reset test net And It's one of the reasons that You know, I've been so focused on Making sure that we get This new hardening functionality On and on to test net Because More of this we can have on test net Unless chance of any kind of a reset Before we release Main net Which is a goal But it's not A requirement, but it's a goal Because it's more efficient We can do More with less work So Um, we do have a release That When we get back around With everybody able to Test and And do the different things To get this going You know, There's hardening on the If Contracts And in the Um, the bridge keeper And either I have time To go back And debug Well, that hardening Because we did it And it's likely not Really that significant But I Do either need to go back And debug that hardening Or we've also Already verified That we can just Revert Some of the hardening that I put in there Leave it for more Um, Test debugging And roll out this release The test net reset Um, I'm just kind of waiting for Some people to really fully recover From a fairly difficult About Of Cop it And when they do And we'll be able to Just make the decision on that Because my preference would be To fix the issues Um, Get the hardening moving forward Closer to main net on the ETH bridge And You know, There is an easy decision to make Which is Let's just shoot for this release Let's get it Um, You know, Ready in the next two days Because it's Current release that we have Which includes the The last private Connections It includes Um, A lot of the main net Level hardening Test net It includes some Actually it includes some Efficiency Performance improvements for Building blocks And, And, Oh, Oh, I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm While it The gooey wall It has a back up scholarships Back up in Restore button These kinds of things Um, there are some nice features in this release And so we'll make a decision in the next few days If we're going to have that released with the Ethereum contact Hardening support For Without And it will be a Testingett Recept When it's released And then we'll move forward from there Um Right But you know one thing One thing that we didn't want to do was do a release reset test net and then still have work to do to bring up the Ethereum bridge again I mean that that is an option but it kind of puts pressure on everyone in a way that might not be ideally what we Want to do to just get all of the technologies ready for me now, but that is the focus right now is to get the D-Fi and And you know it's an unknown so the D-Fi yes that's close enough Ardened enough That isn't far from main net the multi-currency D-Fi The questions are what are the liquidity bridges or bridge that we're going to want to have when we do that release What are the user experiences that we're going to have which actually isn't going to block us because as people who have built platforms understand You know you got to get the capabilities before you Layer the user experiences over them and you know there's a lot of push to You don't have user experiences like you see in in Ethereum but The reason that that is kind of a slap together house of cards and sorry to call it that but that's like what I think it is Is that it's all about user experiences without any fundamental technology underneath the on just links and and Just the ability that yes we can make a user experience that looks like something But it's not necessarily truly decentralized it doesn't necessarily truly scale it doesn't have Not thought through we'll get to that later and Know so what we're doing is making sure that the technologies are there and we're not going to hold as we never have Not going to hold release it like we didn't in wait to release the marketplace technology until Someone with enough vision realized that they could build a marketplace website on top of it even if He were waiting for the web extension we didn't wait for that and We won't wait If we have liquidity which is money and a connection to the defy Technologies we're not going to wait and when we turn that on Yes, we will hopefully have you know the web extension user experience with login and and all of these things that everyone's going to be able to build applications with And we hopefully will see a boom of applications that leverage these technologies because those are Extremely valuable technologies and the people who were able to kind of see things early will benefit and otherwise You know we we're likely to get very busy. I would think and Not the way we've been in building the platform, but busy and just helping people build their applications and We'll write now Unknown is Okay, we know that we want to have an easier or lower cost Model for IDs, but we you know know for sure although No The P-Bass in the cross chain work is in fact Be well hardened and and you know it's getting Are there a long To the point where I think it would be very reasonable Start looking at offering you know Test net level boundaries that If motivation for people to really Cry and get through any of the False chain or any of these things, but we're not quite there yet. It's going to be a release to test net or maybe one or two more but we're we're close and You know there is some question about launching a P-Bass chain and there there's some question around Pardoning that first launch step at aside from that things are Right solid On the same chain multi currency D-Fi those those are quite solid on the All of the M-M's and the multi currency basket those are quite solid And then the question is what are we going to have Are we gonna really just change what what we said and say okay E-Bass is hardened enough and we will actually You know get it out But even if we do Then like that I think it's pretty clear that we want at least fractional currencies or centralized currencies to be able to issue IDs and So right now you know that's likely There's kind of a question we need IDs to be less expensive than the IDs that are on main net Right now the IDs that will be less expensive they won't be able to launch currencies because they're They're either going to be coming off of a P-Bass chain which Think that we need another form of ID which comes off of you know A centralized currency or a fractional currency Because the economic model is quite It's actually quite easy in some of the stuff that I'm doing now or the cross chain Conversions and fee solution Which was one of the last pieces needed for hardening It's also one of the pieces that still needs to be finished inside of the if they're in contracts because it wasn't done other people who were gonna do that So but it is Being completed on all of the cross p-bass chains and It also allows a kind of a Fee model for things like you know IDs and registering IDs on currencies So there's some interesting capabilities that this could enable that wouldn't take long to Make available that could allow for example if I wanted to Make a branded line of NFTs I take my ID I Create some kind of a whether it's a centralized currency or a Refractional currency that I use that people need to pay to buy my um No my NFTs And I make it so that once I've done that that Book and then register either with or without my approval Identities through that currency That can be less expensive than the identities that are on mainnet now But that have you know dot the name of that currency after the identity name Because sub main type name and also Not gonna be able to start their own currencies and they're not gonna be able to start their own chains And there is a really valid you know protocol based reason for that mutation so it all kind of fits And then each Chain including bear us and I think we would want to keep our Our fee on this low Would define the identity import the currency import fee Should then be respected by these cross chain imports and everything and so I kind of I think I've rambled a little bit on this This capability but I but I want it what people understand why we're doing these different things To the point where we can all help You know in cases where it's it's unclear on What we believe we should do so You know for example I'm releasing this EFI Technology two mainnet the first time With multi-currency and everything else it's I have a couple of opinions about What it should have Release and I'm you know in an abstract sense number one I think we need a way I think we need not a need but it's a really strong Support for this release to mainnet and I think it's it's important. It's very important So in a sense I would say it's a need but people can say what they think on this I think we basically need model or Who have ideas to get involved in being able to issue less expensive ideas that's one thing I think that we need a connection to liquidity actually you know aside from Multi-currency defy and liquidity baskets Those are the two most important kind of requirements Of course we want to get the Grab extension the user experiences you know The login server I'd really like to see that done because it's just been Sitting in a state near done but not done for a long time so You know I'd love to see that I want to see a number of things done the I think those are the two These is that I believe we need of course It's a given that everything must be hardened Absolutely hardened and ready for mainnet. That's just a given But the two capabilities I believe we need one was gonna be solved by but isn't quite yet solved by The hardened mainnet ready if they're in bridge but also be solved by a mainnet ready Entryized bridge even if it were a good enough one Basically I believe that and it could also be solved by a project that has some kind of real liquidity Ethereum compatibility and Developers who want to do who want to help Excuse me So Just a moment So My focus now is then to get We've already done a lot of work to enable the And I've done a lot of work to enable Light mode model to be more efficient and more quickly Expose all of our smart transaction functionality There's still some more work to be done there the web extension the Now I'm focused on the core Technologies including Know everything that's gonna be on testnet as well as everything that's gonna be on mainnet being hardened and ready to stand up to a public Missionless mainnet environment and That's where my focus is right now but as I'm doing that That work kind of intersects a little bit with how we will Register sub IDs and so I expect to do that either partially opportunistically or After this is done but I don't expect that to take too long and then You know some Basically if we don't get another answer for liquidity and I think you know the or saymatic wanting to help and have liquidity on their network first versus you know Ethereum Then then I think that we're We're gonna need have some form of liquidity I believe before we will want to release this I feel like it's some Should get it hardened we should be testing it we should be pounding on it and we should be working as Hard as we can to get either centralized you know, feel liquidity connected in in Multi-currency would be best or decentralized Ethereum or other bridges in place Then release mainnet and that's what I think the focus should be and I don't believe that the ID registration for sub IDs is going to be a critical like a Not gonna be a long cool. I'm I'm critical path. I know in development but That's not gonna be you know a hard thing that's gonna take a long time to get finished I don't think it could I don't believe that it would take longer than you know an extra week on top of whatever else is going So That's kind of where things are I think that was a Pretty complete picture. I know I didn't summarize it very well Um, I can take a few questions, but then It did actually spend longer than I expected talking about it went into more detail And so I should drop off and Get back to work on things You know, but I can take a few questions if people have them Well, I don't see any questions superior. I don't see anyone Is microphone So all right, I can say thank you very much for the joke with you and I'm Yeah, I'm gonna have to listen back a couple of times for each month All right, well, thanks. I hope I didn't just lose everybody or you know Rambal and lose everybody. I hope that was useful to some people Really more than just a couple, but And well, you didn't lose me and it's enough to to make some kind of Structured overview from it. Let me put it that way So it'll probably end up in the any monthly newsletter as well Yeah, good update. Definitely good update and thanks for updating us with so much detail All right, well, thanks everybody and Happy new year and let's make this a great one. Thank you
