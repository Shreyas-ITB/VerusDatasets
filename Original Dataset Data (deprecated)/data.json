But \u2013 beyond this currency \u2013 Verus seeks to become much more than a zero-knowledge privacy coin, one with two completely new highly-decentralizing proof of work and proof of stake algorithms.\nIn addition to payments, decentralization, and privacy features, Verus Project\nplans include its direct use as a currency for provisioning scalable and secure public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), for Verus applications built upon these parallel\nchains to scale. What this will do is simple: It will enable all people \u2013 as well as\nall nodes on the Verus network to participate in and benefit from a decentralized,\nblockchain service economy.\nThis paper details the Verus vision and describes the function of Verus as its own\nplatform, and also as a member of the Komodo platform ecosystem, in the context of its\nfirst applications. Verus core applications will provide a foundation to build additional\napplications and services, which will leverage Verus\u2019 automatically created blockchains,\ncalled autochains. Autochains \u2013 or PBaaS \u2013 will be provisioned and notarized by the\nVerus blockchain miners and stakers, in exchange for Verus currency.\nAutochains will be validated through proof-of-stake by their user populations. In\naddition to extremely scalable, dynamic, publicly-secured autochain applications, this\nwill add a dynamic isolation and security component to applications that can also\ncreate, manage, and verify transactions on the main Verus chain or any other Komodocompatible, Crypto-Conditions [17], Interledger Protocol [25] enabled blockchains.\nThe ways we apply this technology to our world \u2013 to our biggest contemporary\nchallenges \u2013 has the potential to completely remake the fabric of our society."

These beliefs underpin everything we build into the Verus network:\n1. We believe that every human has ideas, knowledge, and value to contribute to our\nsociety. By using technology to reward people for their contributions, we can enable\neach of our verifiable, yet anonymous voices to be heard as a collective truth.\n2. We believe that those who contribute positively over time to the system should be\nrewarded for that contribution and provided with ongoing incentive.\n3. We believe that a world-scale, peer-to-peer system that can enable humans to be\nqueried directly, confidentially, verifiably \u2013 and in a transparent manner \u2013 can directly\nprovide populations of people and the world with valuable, transformative tools.\nWith Verus, we will introduce digital tools to enable us all to build a better world\ntogether. We will monetarily incentivize \u2013 with our technologies \u2013 behavior that strengthens\ncommunities and institutions. This is the thing that\u2019s missing in the online world today:\nFiscal incentive for communal behavior built into the very fabric of its function.\nThe Verus Project\u2019s tools will make it easy to create an identity \u2013 or multiple identities\n\u2013 on the Verus multi-blockchain system, which can accumulate value and even have multiple\npersonas, each to represent a facet of your identity as a whole. This reflects how we might\nexpress identity in our personal or professional lives, where some situations call for provable credibility, yet others require no more information than what you might reveal when\nencountering a casual stranger.\nEach identity will have its own, unique address. Unless its owner reveals information\nto link two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard \u2013 meaning virtually impossible\n\u2013 to correlate one identity to another. At the same time, the owner of an identity can still\ncryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to\nidentity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) as strongly as\nis possible with today\u2019s digital technology. As part of the Verus vision, to be described in\nmore detail in later phases, we intend to support fully decentralized verification of identities\nthat can provide as strong verification as today\u2019s centralized systems. At the same time, we\nbelieve it is important for practical reasons to enable compatibility with centralized forms of\nidentity and to enable people to optionally support KYC in identities. To enable a smooth\nbridge between centralized and decentralized identity systems, today\u2019s ID systems, including\nbiometric and government issued IDs, will be supported via centralized or decentralized\nverification to enable use of Verus identity in situations that require conformance to knowyour-customer (KYC) regulations. Theseforms of ID, however, are not required to establish\nor use even strong, decentralized identities on the Verus network.\nVerus autochains, will operate parallel to the main Verus chain and enable large-scale\napplications \u2013 such as polls or elections \u2013 to run simultaneously without concern for congestion or excessive fees. Autochains will enable poll application users to provision their\nown secure blockchains just by using the application \u2013 spawning dynamic parallel chains\nthat can process thousands (or potentially millions) of transactions per second when needed.\nAutochains will operate by proof of stake, enabling each chain to have security isolated to\nits direct user population. Autochains will also be backed by Verus notarization and block\ntime synchronization \u2013 providing the full weight of its PoW/PoS security layer as well as the\nKomodo platform\u2019s delayed proof of work (dPoW), to provide notarization all the way back\nto the full power of the actual Bitcoin blockchain.\nFor Phase II, what we expect to be an extended development phase, we will work to\nimplement autochains and their first application in the world. We will eventually use them\nto create, secure, scale, and perform polls for everything from classifying online content,\nto identifying real public opinion, to actual, real-time elections for an organization or \u2013\nconceivably \u2013 a government.\nOur goal is to make these polls easy to use from a PC or mobile device, yet industrial\nstrength and suitable for serious, secure elections. They will leverage the latest cryptographic\ntechnologies for privacy \u2013 known as zero-knowledge proofs \u2013 to preserve confidentiality.\nThey will be:\n\u2022 Confidential \u2014 No one but the voter knows who or what they voted for \u2013 unless the\nvoter discloses. Results of the vote can be withheld until the vote is complete, at which\ntime they can be released to everyone, simultaneously.\n\u2022 Verifiable \u2014 Only voters that are authorized to vote can vote. Each voter can vote\nonly once. Each voter can look at the released results and see that their vote was\ncounted.\n\u2022 Transparent \u2014 Anyone can validate the number of votes counted, and the number\nof votes,each person or selection received.\n\u2022 Secure \u2014 Our novel autochains \u2013 dynamic, security isolated, proof-of-stake (PoS)\nblockchains \u2013 are layered over proof-of-work (PoW) and delayed proof-of-work (dPoW)\nsecurity, all the way back to the real Bitcoin blockchain through Komodo.\nBy default, the first layer of security is run by the actual voters, themselves. Together,\nthis provides unprecedented layered security both in the autochain and in delayed\nproof-of-work, leveraging the network with the most hash power in the world.\nWe like to think that \u2013 on a Verus autochain \u2013 a 51% attack is called winning a poll.\n\u2022 Scalable \u2014 Each poll is conducted on its own, automatically-created-and-validated\nblockchain, operating under its own visible validation rules."

        "completion": "Throughout history, understanding what a population truly thinks or feels has been an\ninvaluable capability. The manipulation of that understanding can, and has, repeatedly\nchanged the course of history.\nThe Verus Project plans to use highly decentralized blockchain technology to enable all\npeople to safely, anonymously, and confidently express their opinions \u2013 on any issue. Verus\nusers will be able to share their knowledge in a public forum, query a population of humans\n(or eventually both AIs and humans), quickly and effectively, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 earn\ncryptocurrency in exchange for these contributions to collective knowledge.\nA primary goal of the Verus Project is to enable societies and organizations to make\ndecisions based on a more honest understanding of the public\u2019s actual beliefs. To achieve\nthis goal, we consider the need for both confidentiality and transparency, to ensure that \u2013 first\nand foremost \u2013 the system can be trusted. It is also critical to prioritize decentralization and\ndevelop a core platform that can leverage fully transparent blockchain technologies, while\nrunning many applications that respect privacy. With Verus, these applications can leverage\nzero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge \u2013 or zk-SNARKs \u2013 the most\nreliable and tested iteration of proven, zero-knowledge privacy technology available today.\nOur novel approach ensures that this technology can be used at scale, across any population size, throughout the world. Using the tested-at-scale infrastructure and tools of the\nKomodo platform, and Verus planned development of PBaaS \u2013 the Verus developers will\nbuild human organizational tools, including voting and fully self-sovereign identity with a\nreputation system that respects privacy. The goal, here, is a significant one, and these tools\nare planned in a way to allow entire human populations to transparently and directly share\ntheir knowledge and opinions \u2013 without the risk of privacy violation, spin or censorship.\nVerus tools will also leverage human (and eventually non-human) intelligence at scale\nto solve previously challenging problems in a decentralized manner \u2013 financially rewarding\nthose who contribute to their proper function.\nTo serve all people in the world simultaneously with these public, peer-to-peer tools,\nVerus introduces autochains. Autochains are a novel scaling model for blockchain systems.\nAutochains will enable full node miners to provide public blockchain provisioning services.\nThese services will occur in transient, parallel chains, chains that are isolated from congestion,\ndisruption, or interference from the main Verus blockchain. As an autochain operates, it is\nalmost completely parallel and isolated from the main Verus chain, except for the capability\nof posting transactions and proofs to Verus, for results and coordination across applications\nor people.\nBy combining privacy, polls at scale, and identity, Verus can be used to post polls and\nask almost any question of a population or subpopulation of people, receive an honest \u2013 and,\nimportantly \u2013 verifiable answer, and still respect the privacy of the respondents. When even\nthe first support for polling is active on the Verus network, the Verus community will be\nable to vote on the long term direction of the Verus Project, itself.\nOver time, Verus polls \u2013 used for purposes such as determining the accuracy of news\nonline, for research, or even for political polling, will be combined with machine learning\nto enable all of us, as a society, to benefit directly from our collective intelligence without\ntoday\u2019s risks to our individual privacy. Verus will combine auditability and verifiability of\ntransactions with the option of verified, confidential participation \u2013 meaning societies and\norganizations can directly understand what people think, feel, and believe, as populations \u2013\nwithout taking control of their personal data or targeting some individuals, based on their\nanswers or beliefs.\nUltimately, our vision for the Verus Project is to enable us all to directly participate\nin our own worldwide economy. Verus applications will enable any individual to speak up\nwith the power of an authorized participant \u2013 and with the confidence of anonymity \u2013 to\nproduce a verifiable, transparent, and honest flow of information throughout the globe. It\nwill transform the way that anonymity functions in our current technological environment \u2013\nprioritizing cooperation and providing the financial incentive for that cooperation to occur."

        "completion": "The longer term Verus Project vision of a better society through public blockchain services\nrelies upon three fundamental pillars \u2013where the correct operation of each strengthens the\nothers in the form of a virtuous circle.\nThese pillars are:\n1. Extreme transaction throughput and scalable decentralized applications with autochains,\nwhich provide public blockchains as a service (PBaaS)\n2. Selectively strong, private identity, and\n3. Open application support with a foundation of polls, voting, and lottery selection\nservices.\nEach of these pillars will help us process human knowledge, understanding, and/or opinion on any content or topic. Together, they will enable direct querying \u2013 with confidential\nand truthful \u2013 answers across an entire population. It will create a secure, public platform\nthat respects privacy, and can potentially serve as the foundation of a more respectful society.\nIt is also important to know about the the concept of Verus Virtue when reading further\nin this document. The best way to think about Virtue for the purposes of this document\nis as a separate currency that can be earned, but not purchased or sold, and is part of the evolution of the Verus proof-of-stake algorithm, slated for later phases of the Verus project.\nProof of Virtue is a technology that will be described in much greater detail and implemented\nin later phases of the Verus project.\n3.1 Autochains\nWith Verus, we plan to create a platform upon which we will build voting and even election\nsystems that support our vision of enabling a better society through blockchain.\nTo run simultaneous polls across disparate populations on one blockchain-based system,\nwe need another dimension of information \u2013 one that retains privacy, and is anchored to a\nprimary store of value, Verus.\nOne approach to creating another dimension of meaning would be a system of \u201ccoloring.\u201d\nThe Ethereum blockchain system and some layers over Bitcoin or Bitcoin compatible coins\nuse a version of a coloring system. [5][6][7][8]. While, at first glance, this seems like a\nreasonable approach, it is actually a suboptimal solution, at best.\nWith Ethereum and the ICO experiences of 2017 [9][10], we now know what happens when\nyou create one blockchain and overload it with transactions: Congestion and unnecessarily\nhigh fees. Developers have proposed many solutions to this problem of scaling \u2013 including\na move to proof-of-stake systems and sharding (effectively trying to separate the various\nfunctions on a blockchain), or even a move to large systems of parallel chains with a common\ndesign.\nYet instead of implementing a \u201csolution\u201d with colored coins sharing one blockchain, we\nhave decided to take a completely new approach to this problem. Our approach will not\nonly provide an extra dimension of information and an unlimited number of token types,\nor \u201ccolors\u201d, but it will do so with highly scalable PBaaS autochains, which also reward\nVerus miners and node operators as provisioning agents. This is a novel method of scaling,\none which provides significant scale and security benefits through isolation of transaction\nprocessing for each application instance on its own blockchain.\nRather than thinking of Verus as a single blockchain, it is more appropriate\nto think of it as a blockchain-based system, one that is rooted in a primary value\nchain.\nAutochains are exactly what they sound like \u2013 automatically instantiated blockchains\nthat are validated initially \u2013 and when notarizing \u2013 by Verus miners, and otherwise, only by\ntheir users, often a disjoin set from the whole of Verus users. Autochains, once instantiated,\ncan be used indefinitely or can have a finite lifetime to be used for a specific purpose. In\nthis document, we will often discuss autochains in the context of a few concrete applications\nthat we intend to implement on the Verus network. It is important to keep in mind that\ntheir versatility is basically unlimited. Due to their security being inherited from the main\nVerus chain, autochains eliminate perhaps the biggest disadvantage that creating consensusbased distributed ledger applications suffers from: Weak defense against attacks in their\nearliest stages.\nIn Phase II, Verus will define an autochain provisioning protocol, and specific voting\nprotocols, based on blockchain transactions. These protocols will include zero knowledge\nproofs, Crypto Conditions [17], and Interledger Protocol [25] technologies to provide proper\nincentive for all participants to engage in the automatic creation and use of on-demand,\nisolated or public blockchains, ones that rest on a secure, public foundation.\nThe autochain protocol will also provide the ability to place a value on the data generated\nby the autochain\u2019s operation. This value will then either be released to the public or paid\nout, through rewards, to the participants in the creation of that data. This creates a model\nthat incentivizes release of learning and information to the public \u2013 also making applications\nwhich do so much less expensive to run.\nFor Verus poll applications, validation will default to a form of proof-of-stake (PoS),\nwhere all members of the chain are stakers. This is because that security model matches\nexactly the interests of the majority of voters in having an accurate record. Because PoS does\nnot involve powerful mining equipment or competition to solve a cryptographic puzzle, it can\noperate on much less powerful hardware\u2013 even on mobile devices. Since voters, themselves,\nsecure the chain simply by running the voting software, poll chains are generally not affected\nby activity on the main Verus chain (except when posting interledger transactions). In\naddition, an autochain\u2019s operation, independent of scale, adds no overhead or congestion to\nthe main Verus chain\u2019s transaction load \u2013 besides the transactions to provision the poll chain\nand post results back to the main chain itself.\nSince we want to be able to create autochains from clients that may not be running full\nnodes or even own stable IP addresses, full nodes will be incentivized to provide reliable\nstatic node support for autochains. Once they provide this support, they will be recognized by validators on the autochain. They will then be able to use this recognition to boost their\nreputation for selection in future lotteries.\nBy advertising autochain node support on the main blockchain \u2013 along with a stable\npayment address via a transaction \u2013 the node IP can be selected in a random lottery. The\nEigentrust ratings of all nodes can then be recorded by all other nodes that serve the chain\nat regular intervals. Nodes which consistently offer better QoS will get better ratings. Nodes\nthat get poorly rated will still share in the node rewards for the current blockchain \u2013 but\nwill be less likely to be selected in the next node lottery.\n3.2 The Virtue Autochain\n3.2.1 Roots of Trust in Distributed Consensus\nThe Bitcoin [14] proof of work implementation introduced the world to systems that establish\ntrust, not due to belief in any individual human\u2019s behavior, but based on the tendency of\nhumans to act in their own self-interest.\nThe Bitcoin protocol rewards winners of a contest, referred to as \u201cminers\u201d, in statistical\nproportion to the computing power they employ to \u201cmine\u201d for Bitcoin, as compared to the\ntotal computing power of all miners. For every block of validated transactions added to\nthe Bitcoin blockchain, someone wins a competition to earn the right to define that block\nwhile adhering to specific, verifiable rules. The competition involves verifiably solving a\nstatistical mathematical puzzle that is specific to exactly that block, meaning the same work\ncannot be reused on any other block. The winner of each competition earns the right to\naccurately process the next block of pending Bitcoin transactions and to claim a specific\nmeasure of Bitcoin, called the \u201cblock reward\u201d (plus fees of all transactions in the block that\nwas processed).\nMining competition serves to determine the amount of computing power a would-be\nattacker would have to control in order to mine of blocks that were not earned according to\nthe intended rules, execute transactions that might otherwise be rejected, and prevent certain\ntransactions from executing altogether. Based on the way that miners achieve consensus\non what is the correct chain, forging a false Bitcoin chain to achieve this would require\nan attacker to control more than 50% of the total power of all miners \u2013 both honest and\nbyzantine.\nSince, right now, it is likely infeasible for any single actor to mount such an attack against\nBitcoin, the largest network of hash power today, this type of competition, called proof-ofwork (PoW), currently manages hundreds of billions of dollars of value, sends transactions of\nthat value to anyone, anywhere, at any time, and does this all without any company, bank,\nor trusted third party, of any kind.\nIn addition to enabling secure management of large sums of money, PoW has also sparked\na mining arms race and significant investment in computing power to claim Bitcoins and other\ncryptocurrencies, creating the equivalent of the world\u2019s largest distributed supercomputer\ndoing nothing but the same calculations, albeit on different data, over and over again. As\na result, one side effect of the public blockchains\u2019 PoW security system is massive power\nconsumption and significant ecological cost.\nDue to this, a great deal of research and development has gone into alternative consensus\nmechanisms [11][12][13]. Most serious PoW alternatives center around the concept of proofof-stake (PoS) \u2013 the idea, that by putting something at stake commensurate with the value\nbeing transacted in the transaction flow, a rational staking person, known as a \u201cvalidator,\u201d\nwill choose good behavior within the ecosystem, so as not to lose their \u201cstake.\u201d\nEven though large systems are being built that depend on 100% PoS, there remains\ncontroversy over its robustness when users have incompatible interests, or when an attacker\u2019s\nstake is not valued as highly as the perceived value to be gained by corrupting the system.\nMost modern PoS and PoW systems make a fundamental assumption about all miners; that they are either \u2018byzantine\u2019, and intend to compromise the system as a whole, or\n\u2018rational\u2019, in statistically the same proportions for all participants equally. One need only\nconsider that if there was a way to learn a more accurate statistical function for each participant\u2019s probability of being either byzantine or rational, using such a function to determine\nwho participates in the system\u2019s validation would improve its resistance to attack.\nIn fact, any accurate method of recognizing those who were attempting to strengthen\nthe system \u2013 and thus who could statistically be more trusted than a byzantine or even\naverage participant \u2013 could both decrease the power consumption and ecological cost of\nblockchain security and further strengthen resistance to attack. This then brings up the\nquestion: \u201cHow do we recognize trustworthy participants?\u201d\nSome methods studied and proven effective are the Eigentrust reputation management\nalgorithm [20], and its improved derivative the Eigentrust++ mechanism implemented in the\nNEM blockchain [22]. Originally designed by Sep Kamvar, Mario Glosser and Hector GarciaMolina in 2003, the Eigentrust algorithm is built to function on peer-to-peer networks. It\naims to isolate byzantine actors in said networks by assigning each peer a public, global trust\nvalue based on their history of activity \u2013 clearly displaying a form of \u201crating\u201d for each peer.\nThose with lower ratings are shown not to be trustworthy, and thus, are interacted with less\nby their peers.\nSimply put, the algorithm assumes that if any given peer a trusts any given peer b,\nthen it would also trust the peers trusted by b. Every peer calculates a local trust value\nfor each other peer it has interacted with, based on the either satisfactory or unsatisfactory\ntransactions it has had with each one. These local trust values are determined by each peer,\nand when peer a wants to know if they should trust peer b, say, before making a transaction,\npeer a would ask all other peers it knows to report on their local trust values of peer b and\nweigh their responses according to the trust values peer a has for each of them.\n3.2.2 Proof of Virtue (PoV) Reward System\nUsing a model similar to the EigenTrust algorithm, Verus will introduce the idea of Proof of\nVirtue (PoV) enhancement to the PoS algorithm initially released in Phase I. In PoV, we\nintend to weight staking contests with both Verus stake and \u201cVirtue\u201d, a special \u201ccurrency\u201d,\nexpected to be tracked on a Virtue autochain, and used as a trust rating of identities within\nthe network.\nIn a similar way to the \u201camount of stake\u201d used when staking, Virtue will add another\ncomponent to the probability of being selected to process a block of transactions on the\nVerus Network. Its probabilities upon introduction will not change returns on the Verus PoS\nsystem, but addresses will gradually be able to improve earnings with a Virtue weighting \u2013\nbased on recorded activity and behavior.\nIn order to ensure that Virtue is both a rare and valued property, which drives correct\nbehavior, it will neither be purchased, nor sold. Verus holders will have opportunities to\nearn a small measure of Virtue, which can then be further increased by staking the Virtue\nitself, when attesting to a fact for the network, validating information, or providing another\nmeasurable benefit to the network.\nSince Virtue will have intrinsic value on the Verus network, there will be methods for\ntransferring it through wallet ownership \u2013 for cases of probate or other necessity \u2013 but such\nbehavior as a tool for trading in virtue will not provide a secure or intended method of\nexchange.\nThe Proof of Virtue model will effectively be a modified form of PoS that is not based\njust on monetary value, but also on long term measurement of contribution, which will affect\ntrustworthiness and earning power in the Verus network. The intent is to provide opportunities for more people to participate in the growth of a positive functioning network and\nto prevent potential attackers from being able to easily buy their way into an attack, adding\nyet another layer of security.\nWe expect to keep the PoW component as part of Verus security system for an indefinite\nperiod of time. We also expect to leverage the dPoW security of Komodo and its notarization\ninto the Bitcoin blockchain as well.\n3.3 Polls, Voting, and Elections\n3.3.1 The Importance of Secure Polling\nA great deal of research has delved into the best way to achieve confidential, verifiable, and\ntransparent (CVT) elections electronically \u2013 with a few notable systems actually used in\nreal life situations. These attempts, however, have been plagued with significant limitations,\nlimitations that almost always risked either revealing the identity of a voter and thus eliminating confidentiality, or allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate voters, and put the\nvalidity of the vote into question [1].\nThis was shown in one of the first majorly adopted North American electronic voting\nsystems, the Diebold AccuVote TS, which was announced in the year 2000 [4], at a time\nwhen, as a result of the Florida 2000 presidential election, the general public began to\nrecognize numerous flaws in the widely-used punch card voting system [2]. Despite multiple\nstudies discussing electronic voting systems \u2013 studies which clearly warned of security risks\nsuch as insider threats, issues with auditing, and network vulnerabilities \u2013 by 2004, the\nAccuvote TS system was deployed for major political elections in 37 US states [2], resulting\nin multiple serious problems that impact the legitimacy of numerous election results since,\ndue to inherent flaws in its design that were never fully addressed [3].\nFirstly, the \u201csolution\u201d that the system introduced to deal with voters submitting multiple ballots \u2013 and to solve the ballot anonymity problem \u2013 was to issue a single personal\nvoting \u2018smartcard\u2019 to each vote. This smartcard, unfortunately, did not contain a complete\nidentity, but instead contained a common election key among voters that voting machines\nsimply checked to determine if the card belonged in the correct election [2]. The lack of\nany cryptographic unique identification on these cards was a significant security flaw, as\nuser-programmable smart cards and readers almost instantly became commercially available\non the internet for reasonable prices \u2013 making it extremely easy to mass produce homemade\ncopies. Furthermore, due to the lack of a truly secure boot loader, operating system, or application, the system had numerous potential attack vectors, many of which were quite simple\nfor an adversary. For example, any attacker with access to the operating system had the\nability to modify ballot program files through the standard Windows Explorer application\nalready included on each machine.\nThese serious failures in previously adopted electronic voting systems have literally\nchanged the course of history, affecting the outcomes of major political elections that\ndecide the state of world politics. This highlights the importance of creating a system that\nis truly confidential, verifiable and transparent, and indicates the magnitude of one problem\nwe plan to solve with Verus.\n3.3.2 Running, Recording, and Scaling Polls - Transient, PoS Chains\nUsing autochains, Verus will dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each\npoll in its ecosystem. This creates improved, isolated security and allows for scaling in a\nvirtually unlimited manner.\nThe Verus wallet, which will be used for voting, will also have the ability to validate blocks\nthrough proof-of-stake, blocks which, when enabled, will allow voters who are validating the\nelection to earn rewards. These rewards will either be paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls, when\navailable, or from outputs of the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. When a\npoll is complete, results are posted back to the main Verus chain. The chain used to run it\ncan then be archived or deleted, and it is typically abandoned.\n3.3.3 Poll Content and Distributed Hash Tables\nWhile blockchains make excellent databases for permanent, non-repudiable records and public key management, they are not the best solution for storing large amounts of data, due\nto their massive duplication across the distributed network. Instead, a better model for distributed storage would look something like the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which\nis a peer-to-peer file system based on the Kademlia [18]19 protocol in an implementation\nthat currently works well enough to use as storage for create/read/delete operations using\nhash commitments on the Verus blockchain to represent and index content.\nWhile we are evaluating the IPFS, we are also looking at other distributed hash table\nsolutions, such as Open DHT [26]. A key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile\ndevices be able to participate in its operation. Open DHT is an efficient C++ library intended\nfor use with small devices. IPFS does not yet seem to have much support for mobile at this\ntime, though it does have a Javascript library that can be used from the browser or mobile\napcancations [24].\nUntil IPFS is supplanted with another implementation, Verus applications will assume\nthat when off-chain content is needed, it should be retrieved from IPFS, and for future\ncompatibility, we will add a storage and version specifier. In order to store supporting poll\nor other content for dApps, the content owner must ensure that the content is pinned in\nIPFS, until it is no longer needed. By Phase IV, or earlier if there is significant demand,\nwe expect to either support or provide a blockchain-metered storage solution that is more\nintegrated and automatic to use for poll makers. Two options for such a system include\na cross-blockchain integration with a decentralized payment/pinning solution, or to offer\na simple service that charges in Verus to store and automatically pin content for specific\nlengths of time in IPFS.\n3.3.4 Voting Models and Types of Polls\nVerus will support numerous types of polls, those that use weighted or unweighted voting,\nthat seek to expose truth or opinions, and polls that rate and choose collectively. In order to\n13\ncreate a sensible taxonomy for polls, one that people will understand, we define the following\ntypes of voting:\n1. Multiple choice\n2. Weighted multiple choice\n3. Ranking\n4. Rating\nWe also define the following types of polls:\n1. Polls to classify\n2. Polls to select\n3. Polls to rank\n4. Polls to rate\nWe do not expect Verus to support all voting and poll types in the early phases. In fact,\nuntil Phase IV, the Verus core team plans to focus on known requirements of multiple choice\nand weighted multiple choice voting. During or after completion of Phase IV, expanding\nsupport for voting and poll types will be higher priority.\nEach type of Verus poll may support confidential or public voting, live or delayed poll\nresults, online or offline vote authorization, and lottery selected vote authorization. We will\nroll out working vote models in phases, as well, initially providing solutions for weighted and\nunweighted selection voting, which fits well for both political and opinion polls as well as\ncontent classification and ID verification.\n3.3.5 Intrinsic Polls\nOnce Virtue is activated, the Verus network itself will run specific, intrinsic polls that will\nbe regularly available to identities with Virtue, based on a statistical lottery and weighted\nby their actual measure of Virtue. Participating in these polls, which will be used to classify\ncontent and perform basic, human verification functions, enables participants to help the\nsystem classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather\nthan censorship to allow each voter to set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish\nto see.\nMiners who provision autochains for these intrinsic polls will get the same rewards as\nminers setting up autochains for commissioned polls. The content for these polls will be taken\nfrom other polls and will be used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability\nand the user experience of poll services.\n3.3.6 Privacy\nThere is a fair amount of confusion among the public about privacy on the blockchain. One\ncommon belief is that Bitcoin transactions are private, when in fact all Bitcoin transactions,\nas well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information [21].\nAs with the Verus token and its blockchain, poll autochains will also support zk-SNARKs\nto ensure that votes which have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous\nto all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the\naddress that cast them. Currently, based on standard smartphone hardware specifications\nand the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions, mobile phones cannot generate\nz-transactions. In coming releases of new Zcash technology this year, the z-transactions will\nbe more efficient and still provide the same privacy guarantees. When these technologies\nare available, we will work to support them on the Verus chain, as well as use the increased\nefficiency to enable z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices as soon as possible. Until that is available, we will work to provide a mobile wallet for Verus transparent\ntransactions.\n3.3.7 Content Classification\nWhile Verus is designed to provide invaluable tools to people across the world, any system\nwithout censorship will also inevitably allow the underbelly of humanity to show through.\nThat means that while we would want all people to participate, we recognize that in order\nfor that to provide the most positive experience for all participants, we must use the Verus\npoll system itself to recognize, rate, and classify the content on its network, enabling those\nwho provide such a service through participation in polls to earn, while enabling the selective\nfiltering of content based on value judgements and classification of honest populations.\nWhile we recognize that the best early use case for such capability is in rating and\nclassifying non-intrinsic polls themselves, the ability to classify content is a fundamental\nstrength that Verus will increasingly develop over time. At first, we expect such classification\nto be applied to relatively simple tasks for humans, such as identifying toxic comments, hate\nspeech, or categories of information. Even though these types of classification systems have\nlargely employed machine learning systems running against privately curated training data,\nour vision is for Verus content classification to enable people to earn, as they classify content\nbetter than any machine learning system, but in a way that can be followed by the best\nmachine learning algorithms, and generalized at scale.\n3.3.8 Truth vs. Opinion\nWhen classifying content, especially when you start to consider challenging classifications,\nsuch as misleading, propaganda, generally accepted fact, accurate versions of history, vs.\nclassification of what should generally be accepted as toxic or rated content that people could\nreasonably answer objectively, one must consider the difference between fact and opinion.\nSelecting the winner of an election is a matter of expressing an opinion. Classifying content\naccording to level of toxicity is a question of determining the factual answer to the question:\nwhat does the majority of the voting population believe the classification to be. Determining\nwhether an image in one photo is the same image as that from another is a question with\nan objective, if not determinable answer.\nTo ensure that Verus polls support polls that attempt to discover accepted truths, facts,\nand even credible emerging arguments, Verus voters will often be able to stake and either\nearn or lose Verus and in later phases, Virtue, by answering in a manner that matches\nconsensus. For other polls, which are recognized as opinion polls, all answers are equally\nvalid contributions.\n3.4 Random Sampling as a Service\nThe Verus system will randomized selection for many of its functions, similar to its Phase I\nPoS block validation system. Blockchain lotteries will be generalized and used for selection\nof participants in randomized polls and in other cases where pseudo-random sampling is\ndesired. The general principles behind Verus lotteries are the same, regardless of whether\nsomething similar to Algorand [29] for guaranteed selection or an original Verus algorithm\nbased on difficulty, such as Verus PoS is used for selection. Lotteries use the blockchain as a\nrandom oracle and are based on the assumption that the exact value of a specific block hash\nfrom a past block in the chain cannot be modified by a byzantine participant to weigh the\nodds in their favor.\n3.4.1 Participating in a Lottery\nSince the Verus network is completely decentralized, all lotteries, including PoS, are potential,\nand there is no central server selecting and sending messages to those who qualified in a\nlottery. When lotteries are implemented as a general feature, if you would like to participate\nin any Verus lottery or poll that is distributing tickets via lottery, you must first determine\nthat you qualify for the poll\u2019s requirements. You will then need to submit a transaction that\nproves that you have a valid claim and spend the output transaction of the lottery ticket to\nyour address using that proof. By default, that spend will authorize you to be a validator\non the autochain for the poll you are participating in, by providing you with the currency\nof that poll. You may validate the poll by leaving your wallet running, getting potential\nrewards in Verus or Virtue for both activities.\nLotteries will be useful for selecting subpopulations based on identity and claims people\nmake about themselves or that others claim about them, which they are willing to share.\nWhile detailed discussion of Verus identity is beyond the scope of this paper\u2019s release, the\nVerus system will provide self-sovereign identity with the ability for identities to make very\nflexible claims and have them attested to by other identities. For example, a lottery may look\nfor males between the ages of 18 to 25 among identities willing to share that information,\nwhich will even be possible to verify as strongly as through a validated passport or driver\u2019s\nlicense. Other polls may not require the same evidence backing claims. Polls may also have\nrestricted voting, such as local political polls, where verification and authorization for the\npoll must be provided explicitly, often by mail to a physical address or in person in the form\nof a QR code or electronically delivered transaction to your Verus wallet.\n3.4.2 Proof of Stake Lottery\nA block validation lottery is a somewhat different form of lottery which allows you to claim\nthe right to validate a block and its associated reward based on proof-of-stake (for autochains)\nor 50/50 PoW/PoS (for the main chain). The lottery requires that a prior block hash 100\nblocks past combined with a qualifying UTXO of the destination public key hashed with the\nstaking block height and then divided by the UTXO value must be under the current proof\nof stake validation difficulty. By dividing by the UTXO value, Verus weights proof-of-stake\nor proof-of-virtue in proportion to the amount of stake or virtue in the UTXO. If no one who\nqualifies to validate a block is online or no one responds with a submitted block validation\nin a certain amount of time, the blockchain will wait until someone mines a block using\nproof-of-work.\n3.4.3 Ticket Harvesting Lotteries\nThere will be multiple ways to acquire tickets to participate in any particular poll. The\nmanual ways emphasized so far may include receiving a poll with QR code in post or email\nor perhaps directly from someone taking a poll. In addition to these direct ways to receive a\nvoting ticket, Verus will enable polls to be posted on the poll blockchain as transactions, the\ntickets for which are distributed from its outputs by lottery. This will work when the Verus\nID functionality is available, and will enable polls to require presence of specific claims or\nattestations on an ID, as well as the number of participants to select in the poll by creating\none transaction output for each, which is spendable by a cryptocondition [17] that defines\nthe lottery conditions and random difficulty. The difficulty determines how often a particular\nblock will match any attempt to harvest a ticket from that block.\n3.5 Machine Learning Integration\nVerus enables humans to share and expose human knowledge through voting mechanisms to\nmake decisions, express opinions, and classify accurately. The data used for that classification, as well as the classifications or decisions themselves provide an ideal source of training\ndata for machine learning systems across any domain of human knowledge or opinion. As\ncorporations gather, sequester, and learn from massive amounts of personal data in order to\ncompete and boost their bottom line, rather than accrue to society\u2019s benefit, these massive\nprivate databases serve to affect and influence human populations by knowing more about\nthem than others, or even than they know about themselves.\nSince Verus enables humans to use voting mechanisms to classify and make decisions,\nand stores the results of this process in IPFS and on the blockchain, we will train machine\nlearning algorithms on these results over time, allowing them to eventually classify and make\ndecisions consistent with human decisions and values at an even higher scale. This will enable\nVerus to perform certain tasks automatically, such as the recognition of false or incorrect\nidentification data among participants in the system, the initial classification or rating of\ncertain content that can be overruled, but may not be appropriate for all audiences, and much\nmore. The end result of this is a more secure and trustworthy network, built on consensus\nand trustless principles, leveraging worldwide human knowledge as a base of information and\nmachines for scale.\nA major Verus advantage over almost any other system in its use of Machine learning on\nhuman data is the innate privacy it provides to those whose data is used for learning, along\nwith the default that all resulting information be made public, unless those making polls pay\nthe Verus community a going rate to keep the data for themselves. In today\u2019s society, the\ngoal of most machine learning systems is to match consumers with products they are likely to\nbuy and/or manipulate them into an actual purchase, thus generating revenue. This creates\na situation that can create unintended negative consequences when algorithms disregard any\npositive or negative effects its predictive abilities may have on society [23]. For example, if\nthe algorithm recognizes that people with depressive episodes are more likely to gamble, and\nthus buy airline tickets to gambling-oriented locations, such as Las Vegas, it will advertise\nthose airline tickets to those people. In the Verus system, machine learning algorithms will\nbe able to learn from human beings, while being limited to accessing only the data users\npermit, and at the same time, being unable to easily target any specific individual.\n3.6 Verus Mobile Polls\nIn addition to a desktop wallet that supports Verus and other Komodo platforms or compatible applications, mobile support is a high priority and will provide yet another layer of\nconvenience for users, enabling them to use, earn, and spend Verus in everyday life. We intend to provide a Verus mobile experience that functions as a wallet, self-sovereign identity,\nprovides easy access to the polling and earning applications, and is intended to server as an\nextensible application browser, capable of supporting additional applications that leverage\nthe Komodo or compatible ecosystems. While we have already begun thinking about and\nstoryboarding design and development of user experiences, we do not expect any mobile\nexperience to be ready until completion of Phase II at the earliest. Even when the first\nmobile experiences are ready, they will not include the support for private transactions that\nwe intend to enable as a foundation for confidential, mobile polling and communications. To\nget a feel for the way we envision Verus experiences working in practice, below is an example\nof some poll screens from early designs."

Above that, we have already developed advanced features that further enhance\nsecurity, improve decentralization, and prepare for the implementation of autochains and\nproof of virtue.\nWe will maintain our own open source fork of the Komodo platform and collaborate with\nthe Komodo team when possible to develop new features or capabilities that can be accessed\ncross-chain by projects across the Komodo platform and even other blockchains that are\nsimply compatible with Komodo\u2019s Interledger Protocol implementations. We will maintain\nour development as an open source project and contribute back to the broader open source\ncommunity, as we leverage the contributions of others that have made it possible for us to\nbegin realizing our vision as a community.\nAll that said, roadmaps are never perfect. Unless we significantly underpromise and\nprioritize a date so highly that no feature or capability is important in and of itself, targeting\ntimeframes and milestones without specific target dates allows us to be ambitious in our goals\nand adapt to a changing world as we deliver. Even in Phase I, which we have delivered as\nof the writing of this paper, we adjusted our plan, and in an uncharacteristic turn of events,\ndelivered even more than we had originally planned. We do not expect that to always\nbe the case, and we will focus more on correct and complete phases than specific dates\nwhen possible. Sometimes, as with any major endeavor, the right choice is to recognize an unexpected opportunity or obstacle, take two steps to the right or left, and only then proceed\nforward.\nFor the purpose of this whitepaper, we will discuss four phases of the Verus vision. We do\nnot see these four phases as a completion of the vision as much as four phases of an ongoing\nmission to advance Verus and its contribution to society that we can currently express. From\nits inception and throughout the project, the Verus chain will serve as our fungible value\nchain, and use of Verus tokens on this chain will be the core value around which we continue\nto develop the Verus vision.\nThe first Verus chain, which is already available at the time of this white paper\u2019s release,\nincludes zk-SNARKs for privacy, both transparent and private addresses, a brand new CPUmineable hash algorithm for proof of work, a brand new proof of stake algorithm, and a\nunique emission schedule among fair launch cryptocurrency projects. Each phase of our\nproject\u2019s development will introduce capabilities and experiences that provide independent\nvalue on their own, further leverage Verus Coin to power operation, and create a foundation\nupon which to build the next phase. We intend and hope for the Verus project to become a worldwide, inclusive community\neffort, which welcomes and rewards those who contribute. Although we articulate these first\nfour phases here, we see these phases as just the beginning, and we hope you will join us by\nparticipating in and contributing to the Verus project to make our world a better place."

During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining\nand staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block\nrewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions,\npreventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from\napproximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and\n3 months. These time locked coins provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply as\nwell as incentive to all of their owners to support the long term success of the Verus network\nand project.\nFrom the very beginning of its operation, Verus operated with a dual proof of stake /\nproof of work mechanism for all participants. Verus mining with the VerusHash algorithm,\nas of this point, is a CPU-only algorithm, designed with a Haraka512 V2 [30] core to be\nquantum secure and to maximize performance on modern CPUs. While VerusHash was\ndesigned to be CPU-optimized and did not begin life with GPU or ASIC miners capable of\nbeating CPUs in its mining, the Verus developers have no illusions that it is possible someone\nmight develop either a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be meaningfully superior to\nCPUs.\nTo ensure that such a solution if developed, remains open, jl777, lead developer of the\nKomodo Platform, has offered a 1 Bitcoin bounty to any developer who can make and\npublish in an open manner, a GPU miner for the VerusHash algorithm that can significantly\noutperform the current CPU miner. In order to win the bounty, the source code for the\nminer must be available under open source licensing. To be eligible for the bounty, any\nimplementation must be able to perform 5x better than a modern, high thread-count, high\nclock-rate CPU on a GPU costing under $1000. By bringing up the Verus network this way,\nwe established an immediate, baseline set of functionality, above which we can build out\nour project and community around a functional coin and project, as we stay in sync with\nadvancements in the underlying Komodo platform.\nVerus phase one release was pre-announced on Bitcointalk [28] with zero premine, and\nteam members mined and staked along with everyone else to generate coins. In addition to\ncoins mined by individual team members for their own benefit, the Verus developers intend\nto donate most of their mined and staked earnings to a community Verus foundation along\nwith other donating community members who will join us, in order to support the ongoing\ngrowth and project development by core developers and the community for years to come."

Prepare for the full mainnet release of PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) and find great opportunities to maximize profit with your hardware. Mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. With Verus\u2019 hardware equalizing hashing algorithm (VerusHash 2.2) you can mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even ARM devices. In fact CPUs can mine faster than all but extremely expensive, larger FPGAs.\nEfficient Mining\nVerusHash 2.2 is created to level the playing field for all hardware. The hashing algorithm uses the AES/AVX instruction sets built into most modern CPUs to boost CPU hash power.\n\nMine Verus most efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even certain ARM devices. Compare mining hashrates here.\n\nCoinbase Rewards\n1440 blocks are generated each day. On average 720 blocks go to miners, 720 blocks go to stakers (learn more on staking Verus). For generating \u2014 or finding \u2014 a block, miners and stakers get compensated. This compensation is called a coinbase reward. There will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC.\n\nIf you look at the image below, you might think that the possibility of earning VRSC for miners and stakers goes down drastically. We explain next that earnings don\u2019t stop at coinbase rewards.\nEarning from Economic Activity\nMiners and stakers don\u2019t just earn coinbase rewards (the reward for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees include:\n\nPBaaS-chain*: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain\n(DeFi) Currency and tokens*: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200 VRSC\nVerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 VRSC\nConversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs 0.025%\nTransaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001 VRSC\nMiners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase rewards.\n\nThink about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite large.\nMerge-Mine up to 22 Chains\nThe example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!\n\nAnd you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only Verus.\n\nAll these chains have the same consensus algorithm, 50% PoW, 50% PoS, so you can also stake an unlimited amount of PBaaS-chains.\nHappy Mining (and Staking)!\nEveryone in the world can start mining Verus today with our low barrier hashing algorithm.

        "prompt": "Can you give me some information regarding the verus vault and verusID marketplace mainnet upgrade?",
        "input": "",
        "completion": "Buy and sell VerusIDs in a completely decentralized way without any intermediaries. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage for funds in the digital world. Version 0.9.0 also enables Verus Vault on mainnet, the world\u2019s first solution to truly securing your blockchain funds. Use Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and more.\nA Marketplace for Anything\nVerusIDs are much more than a typical digital identity. And once you own one on the Verus blockchain or a compatible PBaaS blockchain, it\u2019s yours forever, rent-free, fully under your control. Until the moment you decide to pass it on.\n\nVerusIDs can be anything you want. They can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to you, or other VerusIDs they have authority or ownership of. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID itself.\n\nEach VerusID on the Verus blockchain can even be used with Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS \u2014 currently on testnet) to launch a token or DeFi currency, and even an interoperable blockchain. These blockchains inherit all features as they are on the Verus blockchain.\n\nVerusIDs can hold funds. They can be personal profiles, corporate websites, or government portals. VerusIDs are much more than identities or today\u2019s NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. And now those assets can be exchanged easily.\n\nWith the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers). If you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized on the blockchain, without any middleman or contract controller.\n\nFor total payment privacy, you can even pay or receive payment using private addresses and zero knowledge transactions based on the Zcash Sapling protocol.\n\nExchanging in Private\nIn addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it\u2019s a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in private.\n\nA powerful use case example: A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content.\n\nNow imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has arrived.\n\nFive New APIs\nVerusID Marketplace introduces five new RPC APIs and CLI commands for this major upgrade: makeoffer, takeoffer, getoffers, closeoffers and listopenoffers.\n\nmakeoffer: define what you offer and for what. What you offer can be funds, VerusIDs, or when PBaaS goes live even other currencies. What you want in return can also be funds, VerusIDs or currencies. In exchange for what you offer, you also define what VerusID or how much you want for it and in what currency.\ntakeoffer: take a specific offer in exchange for its request.\ngetoffers: specify which VerusID or currency you want to see offers for or on offer, and it returns all offers (buy and sell) in all currencies, sorted by highest to lowest price.\ncloseoffers: close expired or unexpired offers which you opened with makeoffer.\nlistopenoffers: list all offers that you have opened with makeoffer.\nProtect Your Funds with Verus Vault\nThe new mainnet upgrade enables a completely new level of security and safety for all your funds. Verus Vault allows you to lock any VerusID under your control, while still using its funds to actively stake and earn on the network.\n\nWhen you lock a VerusID, its funds can not be spent anymore. All locking and unlocking are visible on the blockchain.\n\nTwo Lock Mechanisms\nYou can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the revocation and recovery authorities together.\n\nLocked and unlocked until number of blocks passed: funds can not be spent until a predetermined number of blocks have passed.\nLocked and unlocked with a delay: funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have passed\nPowerful Use Cases\nSafe staking: put funds to stake with on a VerusID. Use Vault to lock the identity with a delay of 10,080 blocks ( ~1 week). Now whenever someone gains access to the private keys of the locked VerusID, they have to unlock the identity in order to spend the funds. When someone makes an unlock request that isn\u2019t you, you are warned. The intruder has to wait 10,080 blocks before he can spend the funds. If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you now have one week to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your control.\nTrusts: setting up a trust fund for your children. Give your child a time locked VerusID with funds on them. When he or she turns 18, the VerusID unlocks and the funds can be spent. Keep revocation and recovery authorities with yourself or a trustee.\nVesting period: when doing a currency or chain launch, development funds can be diverted to a locked VerusID. After two years the VerusID unlocks and the funds can only be spent with signatures of other developers. You can also spread the funds across multiple identities with different unlock periods.\nThese are just a few examples on how the powerful Verus Vault can be used. VerusID can store any asset on the Verus network, including those bridged from other blockchains. When PBaaS is on mainnet, the first bridged asset is Ethereum."

This is part of the predictable and transparent monetary policy, set in place by its inception in May 2018.\nHalving Event\nThe current block reward is 12 VRSC \u2014 which means that miners and stakers who win a block are rewarded 12 VRSC for their efforts of securing the network. This number will go down to 6 VRSC, drastically lowering the number of coins coming into circulation.\nIntroducing the Fee Pool\nWith the PBaaS-mainnet upgrade coming closer, let\u2019s introduce one of its gaming-changing features that will reward miners and stakers with drastically higher block rewards.\nWhen PBaaS is activated on mainnet, anyone can launch blockchains, tokens and currencies, and they can convert currencies through Verus\u2019 L1 DeFi protocol. All these activities cost fees that directly go to the miners and stakers of the worldwide network.\n\nSo even though a halving to 6 VRSC might seem bad for miners and stakers at first glance, a lot of good things are on the horizon."

        "input": "",
        "completion": "New technical capabilities allow influencers and communities to turn social tokens from one-dimensional curiosities into widely usable currencies carrying reliable real world value, that are far better positioned to capture additional value for their issuers and others through building substantial and automated economies centered around the token.\nsocial tokens offer the promise of branded digital currency that allows creators to capture the value created by their community\nin the first generation of social tokens, technical features are one-dimensional, allowing for sending back and forth and to be included in liquidity pools like Uniswap \u2014 they can be related, with hard work, to off-chain economic activity but have no on-chain economics \u2014 actual value is aspirational, not provable, reliable or predictable\nsocial tokens hold promise but have yet to really take off like they should \u2014 leading platforms require programming or a permissioned facilitator, have limited capabilities \u2014 there\u2019s no long tail activity\nadditional capabilities and low-cost permissionless, easy launches will unleash potential \u2014 built-in direct liquidity, stable and predictable values, attached namespaces to create a full spectrum digital goods economy centered on the token; real value creation that is direct and measurable through directly connected on-chain economic activity like nfts, fan profiles, memorabilia, tickets, discount codes, coupons, log-in unlock, etc; measurable economic activity with clear results attracts speculators who can measure and predict engagement that inevitably leads to real value\nthe Verus project, in non-stop development for five years, has built-in blockchain primitives that make these capabilities a reality now, offering more functionality, to more people \u2014 smart contract platforms cannot match these capabilities today absent an enormous engineering effort in bringing together multiple interoperating complex smart contracts\nadditional capabilities include privacy enhancement, moral hazard resistance, easy group dynamics\nprovable decentralized bridges to ethereum give the best of both worlds \u2014 intelligent next generation social tokens that can also emerge automatically, without programming, as ERC-20s\nexperiments to prove these concepts require no programming, are risk-free and extremely low cost \u2014 core protocols exist now, tooling and apps still require build-out in a collective effort\nSocial Tokens \u2014 the Promise\nGoogling the term \u201csocial tokens\u201d brings a host of articles discussing socal tokens as the next big thing. The idea has been around for a while since ERC-20s mainstreamed the idea of token creation riding on top of a base layer blockchain. Creating digital scarcity and expressing that as a transferable token was now possible without creating an independent blockchain; it could be done at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. Soon, people began thinking about tokens where an influencer, brand or community creates a branded token, pre-mines a little bit of it, gets their fan-base/customers/community to transact in it and, presto, the token will start to gain a little bit of value.\n\nThe First Generation\nEarly market leaders soon arrived, such as tryroll.com and rally.io. These platforms are well-funded venture businesses that managed to onboard perhaps thousands of creators into their own social tokens. Despite some fanfare though, there\u2019s not much to these tokens other than\n\nenforced digital scarcity \u2014 they help creators create and issue ERC-20s (or Solana now, for Rally), helping them through what is an otherwise arduous process requiring some skill\nautomated market making \u2014 they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: \u201cencourage their communities to contribute liquidity\u201d\nhanding creators a roadmap and examples to \u201cbuild value\u201d \u2014 this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods \u2014 the idea is to generate real-world demand for the tokens\nOn the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: \u201cAfter minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.\u201d. But, as described in this article, \u201cI discovered that it\u2019s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token going\u201d.\n\nThe end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable value.\n\nAlso, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator\u2019s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator\u2019s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.\n\nNo Long Tail\nAnyone that\u2019s really interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the \u201cdecentralized\u201d blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they\u2019re looking for: \u201c1) Evidence of a significant community size, \u2026 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community \u2026 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.\u201d Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll\u2019s business model is to take a portion of the creator\u2019s token for themselves. Rally\u2019s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the process.\n\nThis makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to \u201cdo it themselves\u201d are met with an arduous and limiting process \u2014 essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.\n\nThe result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There\u2019s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there\u2019s no real innovation and no \u201clong tail\u201d that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to emerge.\n\nNew Capabilities"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What would it look like if there were new capabilities around social tokens? What are some of these, and how would they function?",
        "input": "",
        "completion": "Easy launch \u2014 low cost, permissionless, easy launch through point and click or simple commands. This would lower barriers and allow for just anyone to try out social token experiments. The law of large numbers tells us that some would stumble into real success, perhaps in ways, and through methods, we don\u2019t yet understand.\n\nBuilt-in Direct Liquidity \u2014 five years ago, the Bancor project pioneered smart tokens, which they called \u201cmoney that holds money\u201d. Bancor seems to have abandoned this concept in favor of competing with Uniswap, but the idea has real merit. A social token with this property would not need an automated marketmaker to be able to be a liquid token. Instead, users could convert into and out of the token directly, after first being \u201cseeded\u201d by the founder. This eliminates liquidity provider risk \u2014 and, in essence, every single holder of the token ends up providing liquidity, automatically. This leads to more market depth, and thus more stability and predictability in value. The fact that each token is \u201cmoney that holds money\u201d leads to provable value, and these tokens will be treated with care, as near money. Another result of this capability is that social tokens would have dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses.\n\nAttached Namespaces \u2014 tokens have names, of course. If these are cryptographically unique names (like, for example, crypto addresses), they can be the root of a namespace. ERC-20 names are not unique and so cannot be namespace roots (unless referred to by their contract number). A different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, points to whole new capabilities. For example, if someone called \u201cInfluencer\u201d creates a social token called \u201cInfluencer\u201d, they will have also defined a namespace called \u201cInfluencer\u201d, opening up unique digital goods opportunities.\n\nDigital Goods \u2014 a namespace on a blockchain protocol renders unique power; a simple model for digital goods on a namespace would include:\n\nobject definition \u2014 a protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within the namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. \u201cticket0001.influencer@\u201d or \u201ccoolnft.influencer@\u201d or \u201cschedule.influencer@\u201d\nobject control and transferability \u2014 a protocol could allow defined objects to be controlled by private keys and to be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction, eg. fans could transfer their objects to and from each other at will, or on automated marketplaces without intermediaries\nobjects as destinations/addresses/endpoints \u2014 as addresses on a blockchain protocol, these objects could receive, send and hold funds, or control other objects; eg. money could be sent to or from \u201cfan.influencer@\u201d; also, objects could be endpoints, and so could receive messages or be unique points in a communications network\nobject metadata \u2014 objects could contain space for metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage (either centralized or decentralized, like arweave) to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. Coupled with #3 above this allows objects to exist as NFT art, or verifiable online profiles\nobject signatures \u2014 being cryptographically unique, objects could provide verifiable signatures to arbitrary data, thus allowing for applications like sign-on/access, or voting\nImmediately we see that meaningful digital goods economies could spring up around successful influencers. Examples of such digital goods would be:\n\nFan IDs \u2014 the simple act of creating a fan ID/address for just a few dollars could be seen as a show of support, or status symbol in an influencer community; or fans could create and trade meaningful IDs\nNfts \u2014 influencers, or even their fans, could create digital collectibles/art/memorabilia to be auctioned, sold or given away to fans\nFan Profiles \u2014 updateable, verifiable fan profiles are possible\nTicket \u2014 an object could represent a ticket to an event\nCoupons/gift cards \u2014 an object could represent a right to buy merch\nDiscount Codes \u2014 an object might give a right to get ongoing discounts on merch or events\nMemberships \u2014 an object can provide exclusive membership to influencer clubs or forums\nLog-in/access \u2014 an object can give rights to enter websites or other digital arenas\nVoting \u2014 objects could be used to signal support for an initiative, idea or proposal\nThis is far from an exhaustive list, and the \u201clong tail\u201d will surely draw out ideas which we\u2019re not even capable of conceiving right now. Many of these goods would be automatic or community created and so could thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. This is important for the longevity of the social token economy. It\u2019s not difficult to see how strong community-created activity could thrive and persist.\n\nAn Economic Model for the Digital Goods \u2014 to capture value for the issuing influencer (and others), there is no necessity ever to sell tokens directly to the public (which might bring securities laws into the issue anyway). The social tokens would always be just a commodity/good/coupon that can be acquired to show support, or to be used (exclusively) to acquire digital goods like those described above. An issuer would always, likely, issue \u201cfree\u201d tokens to themself as part of the creation process (a \u201cpremine\u201d), or retain the right to issue new tokens at will (perhaps only after the passing of a period of time). They would also need to \u201cseed\u201d the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of \u201creal\u201d currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token\u2019s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their \u201cpremine\u201d, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the token.\n\nWith this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power. Speculators like these would be analogous to collectors who have an eye for talent, and that can spot trends. All they need to do to profit is to get in early on the right tokens by the right influencers with the right potential economic activity that would *inevitably* drive value increases. In this way, market dynamics might allow influencers to capture future value today.\n\nThis Exists Today \u2014 the Verus Project\nThis is not just theory, but is about to be put into practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the Verus Project has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the network.\n\nThese capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little cost.\n\nAdditional Capabilities\nApart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user\u2019s privacy as they interact with social tokens.\n\nAlso, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and \u201crugging\u201d their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers. Unfortunately, a security incident at Roll led to these \u201cescrowed\u201d amounts being stolen and liquidated.\n\nSocial tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.\n\nFinally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus mainnet.\n\nStatus\nThese protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop tools and applications and businesses leveraging the protocols."

Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.\nThe Problem\nLike any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community\u2019s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community\u2019s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That\u2019s what this sample case study is about \u2014 let\u2019s call this value created by a community, \u201cCommunity Contributed Value\u201d.\n\nObserving this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of the US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong dollar.\n\nIn addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.\n\nSolutions \u2014 pre-Blockchain\nAll of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can\u2019t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard \u2014 and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran aground.\n\nSolutions \u2014 in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era\nInterest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), and the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.\n\nIt seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues are:\n\ncommunity currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement\nthere is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short term\nthere is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value\nthere are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods economy\nNew Solutions \u2014 Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a service\nIt is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {\u201cCommCurr\u201d}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, and hard to resist.\n\nOne of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency\u2019s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn\u2019t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this area.\n\nAt about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin\u2019s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of life.\n\nThey began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publicly available, including the ability to run advanced Community Currency experiments that are virtually risk-free for communities, can be carried out at low cost, and have several elements that will make them attractive and safe for broad community use.\n\nTwo key points to note about the Verus protocols, software and network are:\n\nno venture capitalists or investors have been involved in its financing or development, so there is no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors \u2014 it is rent-free technology, the only payments necessary are network fees to provide sufficient incentive for outsiders to provide their compute resources to power the network; and\nVerus does not use smart contracts \u2014 it is based on more traditional and longstanding distributed computing paradigms, and users access the software for basic primitives, which they then put into use and combine however they see fit. No contract programming or special blockchain engineering skill is required to carry out sophisticated actions. Recently, on the Verus testnet, one community member (a non-programmer) implemented a powerful community currency example in less than ten minutes with a few simple commands.\nCurrency Reserves \u2014 Convertibility\nVerus provides the ability to define new tokens/currencies at will, without programming. Various options are available, as tokens carry a multitude of possible uses, from voting to tickets to currencies. For community currency experiments, one of the key options is to lock in reserves that are attached to, and back the value of, the newly issued currency. And, since Verus is bridgeable to and from the Ethereum network, you could back a new currency with ethereum or USDC or any other valuable currency from that network.\n\nIf a CommCurr is defined with reserves backing it, then users can freely mint new currency by converting their USDC, for example, directly to CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible fees.\n\nReserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency \u2014 it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.\n\nThese few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies \u2014 USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of USD.\n\nAs a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr \u2014 it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.\n\nCapturing the Contributed Value\nWhen creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let\u2019s say it\u2019s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We\u2019ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the USD.\n\nNow, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they\u2019ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they\u2019d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they\u2019ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they\u2019ll simply promote its use, or maybe they\u2019ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It\u2019s important to note that if the issuing community doesn\u2019t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the USD.\n\nIf regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let\u2019s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they\u2019d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the USD.\n\nSo now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value \u2014 in this case it\u2019s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with USD..\n\nNo Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer)\nDid the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly make $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community\u2019s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.\n\nIt is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.\n\nCommunity members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.\n\nGovernance\nThere are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.\n\nMoral Hazard \u2014 Escrow\nAnother blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there\u2019s no adoption, they wouldn\u2019t have access to their original capital until the unlock period passes.\n\nWait, There\u2019s More \u2014 Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the Currency\nPossibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name \u201cidentities\u201d. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the \u201cidentities\u201d are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original issuer).\n\nCommunity members might seek to register identities for many reasons:\n\nto signal support for the community\nto have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. \u201cmember.CommCurr@\u201d\nto create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (\u201cidentities\u201d are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)\nto be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a club\nTo be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board, etc.\nThese are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.\n\nConclusions\nThese are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.\n\nCurrently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It\u2019s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development."

        "prompt": "What is verus basic defi?",
        "input": "",
        "completion": "Verus is a UTXO-based cryptocurrency with DeFi in its consensus protocol. In this first vBasics-series, we explain what liquidity pools, automated market makers and fractional currencies are, and how they function in the Verus ecosystem.\nVerus is a foundational blockchain that builds key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol. DeFi is one of those key primitives, and quite difficult to wrap our heads around. Especially as the words we use can be confusing. This is new technology so we make it up as we go. DeFi systems we know use words like \u2018automated market makers\u2019 and \u2018liquidity pools\u2019. Verus adds \u2018fractional currency\u2019 to the terminology.\n\nIn a DeFi system there are no people you buy or sell your currency to. You only interact with a pool of liquidity. Inside this pool of liquidity can be many different currencies, small or large amounts. The liquidity pool is attached to a currency. The currency that is attached to the liquidity pool has a value that is determined by what is in the liquidity pool (image 1).\n\nImportant note: in the Verus ecosystem, all currencies with liquidity pools have adaptive supplies.\nLet\u2019s start by explaining currencies that are backed by 100% (see image 2). In our example we have NewCurrency. This currency is backed by 100% and has VRSC and ETH in its liquidity pool (A).\n\nIn a currency that is 100% backed, the value is always equally divided by the number of currencies in the liquidity pool. NewCurrency has 1000 VRSC and 2 ETH in its liquidity pool. And even though they are different values, and they have different values outside the Verus ecosystem, they still represent 50/50% of the value (B).\n\nLet\u2019s say the currencies in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency have a value of both $500. Consequently, the value of 1 NewCurrency is $1000 (C).\nSo, depending on what is in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency, the price of the currency fluctuates. Here comes the term \u2018automated market maker\u2019 in play. No person sets the price of the currency, it is fully automated. Anyone at any time can interact with this currency because there is always a value, and always liquidity. Which means it is an always \u2018on\u2019 market maker. A fully automated market maker.\n\nYou might ask yourself: why is there always liquidity? This is because a liquidity pool can never be really empty. One can always add or take out VRSC and ETH. When a balance tips too much to one side, there is opportunity to arbitrage and make money. There is always something to trade against.\n\nNow why would someone want to convert their VRSC or ETH to NewCurrency? This is a portfolio management choice. NewCurrency acts as a constant-mix strategy. You are exposed to two different currencies, while holding only one. By holding NewCurrency you also earn fees from people converting, more on this later.\n\nA Verus DeFi currency that is backed by 100% can have many more currencies than just two in its liquidity pool. All kinds of combinations are possible (image 3).\nIn the Verus ecosystem we call a currency that has a pool of liquidity attached to it a \u2018fractional currency\u2019. The currencies that are in the pool of liquidity we call \u2018reserve currencies\u2019, see image 4.\nTo make it a bit more complicated, let us explain why we call these currencies \u2018fractional currencies\u2019. In our example before (image 2) we showed a fractional currency that derives its value 100% from the reserve currencies: it is backed 100%. In the Verus ecosystem, we can have fractional currencies that are partially, fractionally, backed by a number between 5 and 95%, see image 5.\nHow one creates 100% backed or partially backed fractional currencies differs. A user can create a currency and define that the currency is 100% backed. A user can not define the fraction between 5 and 95%. The number of backing by a fractional currency is dependent upon market forces before the currency is launched.\n\nOne can ask, what is the consequence that a currency is backed by 10, 50, 80 or 100%? The difference is the curve of price vs supply. And remember, the fractional currencies have adaptive supplies. See image 6 for a simplified illustration.\nConverting From Reserve to Reserve\nWe have explained how one can always convert to a fractional currency with its reserve currencies. Or back to a reserve currency with the fractional currency. In the Verus ecosystem there is another way to convert currencies.\n\nWe call this converting through the fractional currency. One doesn\u2019t acquire the fractional currency, but converts through the fractional currency to a reserve currency. To simplify: one converts one reserve currency to another reserve currency. See image 7 for the different conversion possibilities within our NewCurrency example. Remember that all the currencies (fractional & reserves) have a value relative to each other.\n\nFor example, if one owns VRSC, they can convert it to ETH through NewCurrency. In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, if one wants to convert VRSC to ETH, the protocol searches through all the fractional currencies with both VRSC and ETH in its reserves, presenting you the best price for conversion (image 8).\nThere is always a value, and always liquidity attached to the fractional and reserve currencies. It will always be possible to obtain a fractional currency, or convert to a reserve currency with any of the many fractional AND reserve currencies that will be available in the Verus ecosystem.\n\nImportant note: all fractional currencies on the Verus blockchain must have VRSC as one of its reserves.\n\nEarning Fees\nLike we discussed earlier, holding a fractional currency is besides a portfolio/investment strategy, an opportunity to earn fees.\n\nLet's say one holds NewCurrency from image 2. Every time a user converts VRSC to ETH, or ETH to VRSC, 0.025% of the transaction in VRSC stays in the NewCurrency reserve. This means that the total value of NewCurrency goes up which is beneficial for the holder.\n\nJoin the Revolution\nWhat makes Verus unique compared to its competitor Ethereum, is that in Verus all blocks are solved simultaneously. Front-running will not be possible. Read more in-depth information on the differences between Verus and Ethereum DeFi.\n\nA giant system of liquidity will emerge, with value flowing in every other direction. Many times the value of the currencies in the Verus ecosystem will not be aligned with the same currencies outside of the ecosystem. Many arbitrage opportunities will arise which means more value flowing into the system."
